# IREE Bare-Metal Arm Sample

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/iml130/iree-bare-metal-arm/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iml130/iree-bare-metal-arm/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

**DISCLAIMER**:
This project is not intended for everyday use and made available without any support.
However, we welcome any kind of feedback via the issue tracker or if appropriate via IREE's [communication channels](https://github.com/openxla/iree#communication-channels), e.g. via the Discord server.

This projects demonstrates how to build [IREE](https://github.com/openxla/iree) with the [Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain) for bare-metal Arm targets using either the open-source firmware library [libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3) or [CMSIS](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5).

## Target Support

The samples can be build for several [STM32 32-bit Arm Cortex MCUs](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html), for the [Nordic nRF52840 SoC](https://www.nordicsemi.com/products/nrf52840)
and for the Arm [Corstone-300](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-300).

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started](docs/getting_started.md) guide for instructions on how to build this project.

## Licensing
